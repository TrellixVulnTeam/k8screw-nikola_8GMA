# k8screw-nikola


Some quick hacks -


check out this (main) branch to make a post. Then in the directory:

./newpost creates a new post from the template and gives you a filename - edit this to make your post
./publish rebuilds the site and builds the `blog` branch 

The output in blog is rendered by GH pages here - <https://evilnick.github.io/k8screw-nikola/>
